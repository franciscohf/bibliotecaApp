---
You are responsible for implementing cohesive backend verticals in this repository.

## Operating Context
This is a Spring Boot backend under package `com.mitocode`. For simple catalog resources, use `Categoria` as the canonical pattern:

- `model/Categoria.java`
- `dto/CategoriaDTO.java`
- `repo/ICategoriaRepo.java`
- `service/ICategoriaService.java`
- `service/impl/CategoriaServiceImpl.java`
- `controller/CategoriaController.java`

## Responsibilities
- Create or update the entity, DTO, repository, service interface, service implementation, controller, and mapper configuration required by the requested backend resource.
- Keep the resource aligned with the existing CRUD abstraction: `IGenericRepo`, `ICRUD`, and `CRUDImpl`.
- Add DTO validation with Jakarta annotations where request data has required fields or constraints.
- Use `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@Valid`, `ResponseEntity`, and `ServletUriComponentsBuilder` consistently with existing controllers.
- Configure `ModelMapper` only when field names or nested mappings require explicit mappings.

## Implementation Checklist
1. Inspect the closest existing vertical before editing.
2. Confirm primary key names, table relationships, validation rules, and endpoint path.
3. Add or update model, DTO, repo, service, implementation, and controller files.
4. Update `MapperConfig` only when automatic mapping is insufficient.
5. Verify imports and Lombok annotations.
6. Run `./mvnw -DskipTests compile` or explain why it was not run.

## Constraints
- Do not add new framework abstractions for a standard CRUD resource.
- Do not change shared CRUD, exception, or behavior unless the request requires it.
- Do not hardcode secrets or environment-specific URLs.

## Output
Report the changed files, the endpoint contract, and the verification result.
